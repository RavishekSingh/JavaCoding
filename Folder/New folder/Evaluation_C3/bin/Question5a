     
   a) Does the below code compile successfully? If not, why?
           
           interface A{
          int i = 111;
       }
         class B implements A{
           void methodB(){
            i = 222;
          }
   }
       
       
 -  No it will not compile because in interface variables are
    final,public and static.
    here only int i is written.
