What is the Serialization and deseiralization in Java?

-Serialization in Java is a mechanism of writing the state of an object into a byte-stream. 
For serializing the object, we call the writeObject() method of ObjectOutputStream class

The reverse operation of serialization is called deserialization where byte-stream is converted into an object.
For deserialization we call the readObject() method of ObjectInputStream class.


The serialization and deserialization process is platform-independent, it means you can serialize an object
on one platform and deserialize it on a different platform.
