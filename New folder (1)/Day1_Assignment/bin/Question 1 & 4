 Explain difference between PriorityQueue() and LinkedList()?

 
 -Priority Queue is an abstract data type that is similar to a queue, and every element 
 has some priority value associated with it. The priority of the elements in a priority
  queue determines the order in which elements are served
  
  
 -Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list 
   elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.
   They include a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the data and the address 
   of the next node.
   
   
   
  Explain Generics in Java and Its Importance with example?
   
 -Generics means parameterized types. The idea is to allow type (Integer, String, â€¦ etc., and
  user-defined types) to be a parameter to methods, classes, and interfaces. Using Generics, it
  is possible to create classes that work with different data types. An entity such as class,
  interface, or method that operates on a parameterized type is a generic entity.
  
  e.g;
  
     class Test<T> {
   
    T obj;
    Test(T obj) { this.obj = obj; } // constructor
    public T getObject() { return this.obj; }
 }
  

       class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // instance of Integer type
        Test<Integer> iObj = new Test<Integer>(15);
        System.out.println(iObj.getObject());
  
        // instance of String type
        Test<String> sObj
            = new Test<String>("GeeksForGeeks");
        System.out.println(sObj.getObject());
    }
}
