- Explain the meaning of the deadlock in multithreaded application, when it can occur in
multithreading applications.Write one example of deadlock.?


- A lock without key is nothing but commonly known as Deadlock in multithreading,
if two synchronized threads are waiting for each other forever(infinite time) then there is a
condition of deadlock.

The synchronized keyword is the only reason for deadlock.
There is no any suitable solution for it but there are few preventions for it.

Solution for Deadlock:   If for any method from  class A or class B we remove synchronised 
                         keyword then there will be no deadlock.
