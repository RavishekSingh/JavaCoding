2) When should one use Maven?


-Maven is a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (project object model). 
 It is used for projects build, dependency and documentation.
 Maven is chiefly used for Java-based projects, helping to download dependencies, which 
 refers to the libraries or JAR files. The tool helps get the right JAR files for each 
 project as there may be different versions of separate packages.
 
 
 
 3) Explain the core concepts of Maven.?
 
 
 -Maven is based on the concept of project object model (POM) file. POM is an XML file which
  contains project resources like source code, test code and dependencies (external JARs) etc.
  The POM file should be in the project’s root directory.
  
  Maven Core Concepts:

  POM Files
  Build Life Cycles, Phases and Goals
  Dependencies and Repositories
  Build Plugins
  Build Profiles
  
  
  
 4) Explain about the basic properties of pom.xml file.?
 
 
 -The pom. xml file contains information of project and configuration information for the maven
  to build the project such as dependencies, build directory, source directory, test source directory,
  plugin, goals etc. Maven reads the pom. xml file, then executes the goal.
  
  
  
 5) What are the different phases of the default life cycle?
 
 
 - The default lifecycle comprises of the following phases :

 *validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
 *compile - compile the source code of the project
 *test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
 *package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
 *verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
 *install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
 *deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects. 
 
 
 
 6) What are the different types of Maven repositories?
 
 
 -A maven repository is a directory of packaged JAR file with pom.xml file. Maven searches for dependencies in the repositories.
  There are 3 types of maven repository:

 *Local Repository
 *Central Repository
 *Remote Repository

 Maven searches for the dependencies in the following order:

 Local repository then Central repository then Remote repository.
 
 
 
 7)Explain what a Primary key, Candidate Key, Prime Attributes, and Non-prime Attributes is.?
 
 
 - Primary Key- A primary key is the column or columns that contain values that uniquely identify each row in a table.
                A database table must have a primary key for Optim to insert, update, restore, or delete data from a database table.
                
   Candidate Key- A candidate key, or simply a key, of a relational database is a minimal superkey.[1] In other words, it is any set 
                  of columns that have a unique combination of values in each row (which makes it a superkey), with the additional 
                  constraint that removing any column would possibly produce duplicate rows (which makes it a minimal superkey).        
                  
    Prime Attributes- A prime attribute is an attribute that is part of any candidate key. It can also be used to uniquely identify a
                      tuple in the schema. A prime attribute in DBMS is also known as a key attribute.      
                      
   Non-Prime Attributes-Non-prime attribute − An attribute, which is not a part of the prime-key, is said to be a non- prime attribute. 
                        If we follow second normal form, then every non-prime attribute should be fully functionally dependent on prime key attribute.  
                        
                        

8) What are the rules for a table to be in 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF?
