Explain Difference between Upper Bounded Wildcards and Lower Bounded Wildcards with Example.


-Upper bounded wildcards is used to relax the restrictions on a variable. 
For example, if we want to write a method that works on List<Integer>, 
List<Double>, and List<Number>; we can achieve this by using an upper bounded wildcard.

e.g;
      public static double sumOfList(List<? extends Number> list) {
               double s = 0.0;
              for (Number n : list)
                 s += n.doubleValue();
                return s;
        }
        
        List<Integer> li = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);
        System.out.println("sum = " + sumOfList(li));
        
        
-Lower bounded wildcard restricts the unknown type to be a specific type or a super type of that type.
 Lower bounded wildcard is expressed using the wildcard character ('?'), following by the super keyword, 
 followed by its lower bound: <? super A>.
 
 e.g;
       public static void addNumbers(List<? super Integer> list) {
               for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                list.add(i);
           }
        }
