examples of checked and unchecked exception classes.


-Exception classes are categorized in 2 category:

1.Checked Exception (checked by the java compiler whether we have handled that 
  exception class object or not at compile time)

  ex:     ClassNotFoundException
          IOException
          SQLException
          FileNotFoundException
          


2.Unchecked Exception (not checked by the compiler whether we handled exception class object or not)

  ex:   NullPointerException
        ArithmaticException


 Whether exceptions is a checked or unchecked exception, exceptions always occurs at runtime, it never 
 occurs at compile time, compile time only occurs compilation error.
