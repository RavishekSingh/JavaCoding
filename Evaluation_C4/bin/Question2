Explain about Hashcode and Equals Method.


- To find the object uniqueness we use equals() and hashCode().

For two objects equals() will return true then their hashCode value 
should return the same value for the object.

equals() compares the equality of two Objects.

e.g;  public boolean equals(Object obj)


hashCode returns the value as an integer.Ii's value is mostly used in
hashing purpose like HashMap, HashSet, HashTable.
This method must be overridden in every class where overrides equals()method.

e.g;  public int hashCode()
