2) When should one use Maven?


-Maven is a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (project object model). 
 It is used for projects build, dependency and documentation.
 Maven is chiefly used for Java-based projects, helping to download dependencies, which 
 refers to the libraries or JAR files. The tool helps get the right JAR files for each 
 project as there may be different versions of separate packages.
 
 
 
 3) Explain the core concepts of Maven.?
 
 
 -Maven is based on the concept of project object model (POM) file. POM is an XML file which
  contains project resources like source code, test code and dependencies (external JARs) etc.
  The POM file should be in the projectâ€™s root directory.
  
  Maven Core Concepts:

  POM Files
  Build Life Cycles, Phases and Goals
  Dependencies and Repositories
  Build Plugins
  Build Profiles
  
  
  
 4) Explain about the basic properties of pom.xml file.?
 
 
 -The pom. xml file contains information of project and configuration information for the maven
  to build the project such as dependencies, build directory, source directory, test source directory,
  plugin, goals etc. Maven reads the pom. xml file, then executes the goal.
  
  
 5) What are the different phases of the default life cycle?
 
 
 - The default lifecycle comprises of the following phases :

 *validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
 *compile - compile the source code of the project
 *test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
 *package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
 *verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
 *install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
 *deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
