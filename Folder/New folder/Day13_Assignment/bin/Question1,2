Explain about the Marker interface?


- It is an empty interface (no field or methods). 
  Examples of marker interface are Serializable, Cloneable
  and Remote interface. All these interfaces are empty interfaces. 
 
e.g:
      public interface Serializable 
   {
        // nothing here
  }
  
  
  
  Why multiple Inheritance is not supported in Java at the class Level?
  
  
  - Multiple inheritances lead to ambiguity.For example, if there is a 
    class named Sub and there are two classes Super1 and Super2 and if 
    both contains a method named sample().
    And if the class sub inherits both classes Super1 and Super2 then there
    will be two copies of the sampling method one from each superclass and it
    is ambiguous to decide which method to be executed.
