Explain the difference between abstract class and interface.

Abstract Class - An abstract class can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods.
                 An abstract class can have all four; static, non-static and final, non-final variables.
                The keyword ‘extend’ is used to extend an abstract class
                It has class members like private and protected, etc.
                
Interfce -   Interface contains only abstract methods.
             Only final and static variables are used.
             The keyword implement is used to implement the interface.
             It has class members public by default.
